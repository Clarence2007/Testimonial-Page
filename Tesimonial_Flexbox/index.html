                            amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                            found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                            weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                            completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as
                            a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

                            developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal

                    <h5>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h5>
                    <p>“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I
                        needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                        programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                        The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
                        hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
                        next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
                        often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
                        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
                        developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
